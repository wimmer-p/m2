## Features
1. **Input Handling**
   - Accepts an Excel file with daily average water level data.
   - Processes columns for date and water levels for multiple lakes.

2. **Data Processing**
   - Cleans and validates input data.
   - Calculates yearly average water levels for each lake.

3. **Output**
   - Exports results to a new Excel file with units clearly labeled.
   - Creates bar charts with trend lines and proper annotations.

4. **Error Handling**
   - Ensures input data validity.
   - Exits gracefully with informative messages if data is missing or invalid.

## Program Workflow
1. **Input**:
   - Load an Excel file containing daily average water levels.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Standardize column names.
   - Convert date columns to a consistent format.
   - Ensure numeric formatting of water level values.

3. **Validation**:
   - Check for the existence of valid data.
   - Terminate if no valid data is found.

4. **Computation**:
   - Group data by year and compute mean water levels for each lake.

5. **Visualization**:
   - Generate bar charts for yearly averages.
   - Add trend lines and annotate with units.

6. **Output**:
   - Save processed data to an Excel file.
   - Export visualizations as images.
